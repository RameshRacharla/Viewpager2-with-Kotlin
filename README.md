# Viewpager2 with Kotlin Support
Display Views or Fragments in a swipeable format. ( ViewPager2 is the replacement of ViewPager in AndroidX)

The biggest change in the ViewPager2 is that we can use in the RecyclerView.
We need to migrate to AndroidX because ViewPager2 doesn't support in the android.support library

# ViewPager2 supports vertical and Horizontal scroll support:

For Vertical scroll:
# viewPager2.setOrientation(ViewPager2.ORIENTATION_VERTICAL);
For Horizontal scroll:
# viewPager2.setOrientation(ViewPager2.ORIENTATION_HORIZONTAL);
